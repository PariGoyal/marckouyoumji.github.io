## Project Idea

The idea is to have an automated and secure smart parking garage-system.
It will have the ability to grant or deny access to vehicles trying to enter the parking space through a password. We also included automated lighting
that turns on if a presence is detected and turns off after fixed period of time. In addition to that, it will be possible for the owner to customize 
the application by changing the password and being able to modify the timer value
